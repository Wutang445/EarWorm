# EarWorm

Created by Wutang445 as part of a Hackathon

Ever get a song stuck in your head that you can't seem to pinpoint? It can get annoying trying to google that one lyric and getting a barrage of results that don't pertain to your search at all.

I created EarWorm as a solution to this problem, since I tend to have the same frustrations with identifying certain songs from memory.
