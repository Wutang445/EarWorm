# EarWorm

Music is everywhere. Once in a while, you may hear a song and want to know the name and artist, but the moment passes before you can look it up. Later in the day, you may keep hearing the song over and over, playing back in your head like an imaginary jukebox on repeat. You log onto Google and look up the few words you heard, but all the results are for food recipes and businesses. How can you possibly find out what the song is?

I built EarWorm with the express purpose of solving this simple problem, mainly because I suffer from the same thing. I hope you enjoy it, I add some improvements as I get better with the various technologies I learn.
